# Notr
###Intro
Notr is a text visualization software based on AngularJS with dynamic mind mapping capabilities. 

There are many applications of mind mapping: it is a clear data visualization tool, discover trends by combining different graphs, and can help you trace through your previous thoughts.

###Problem & Solution
Mind mapping is a very powerful idea but every software package requires the user to specify where the nodes go including Prezi, Mindmeister, Nova Mind and others which make it cumbersome and slow to develop a mind map. We aim to create a text based application that can parse the nodal relationships and render them on a graph.

Notr addresses this problem by allowing users to 
-render nodes on the graph according to simple syntax and structures.
-speak about the two interfaces. UI combines a text editor and a display for the graph.
-@, #, -, and id. (Parser).
-render graph with said relationships.

###Applications
Authenticated login system, file management cloud, different types of trees, animation, exports and more.
